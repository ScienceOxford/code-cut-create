    <h1>Codeblocks Set Up</h1>
    <p><strong>If you are in our workshop at the Science Oxford Centre, this section has been done for you.</strong></p>

    <h3>Getting started with Tinkercad Codeblocks</h3>
    <p>Log into Tinkercad using your own account, or the classroom code and nickname we provided during the workshop.</p>
    <p>Once logged in, click New, and Codeblocks, to start a new project.</p>
    <img src=".\images\create-new.PNG" alt="screenshot of Tinkercad, showing a blue button with a plus sign, labelled New, and three options underneath; 3D Design, Circuits, Codeblocks. Codeblocks is surrounded with a red box." width="300px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Click 'New Design' from the pop-up.</p>
    <img src=".\images\new-design.PNG" alt="screenshot of Tinkercad, showing a white box labelled Designs, with two buttons on the right. The second buttonis blue and labelled New Design. This button has a red arrow pointing at it." width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>You should now see an editor like the picture below. If it looks very different, click the Tinkercad logo on the top right to get back to your Dashboard, and carefully follow the previous instructions again.</p>

    <br>
    <p><strong>The Cricut can only cut flat objects.</strong> It is like a very precise pair of scissors! Your design may look 3D, but the machine will only cut the outline, so think carefully about what shapes you choose to use.</p>
    <p><em>For a more detailed explaination, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Designing-in-Tinkercad-for-a-Laser-Cutter/" target="_blank">take a look at our Instructable</a> (up to Step 6).</em></p>
    <p>To help you to see the final design, change the view options so it will look flat.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Important:</strong> on the output section on the right, click the orientation cube, where it says Top - this switches to the top view.</li>
      <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> below this cube, and below the plus and minus zoom buttons, click the other button to switch to Flat View.</li>
      <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> change the title of your design, on the top left.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your final workspace, all set up, should look like this:</p>
