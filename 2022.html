    <h1>CCC - Code Cut Create</h1>
    <p>Resources for the 'Code Cut Create' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will use Tinkercad Codeblocks to design a 2D object (e.g. a snowman) to cut out on a Cricut machine.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Dec22CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>

  <div id="intro" class="left">
    <h3>Getting started with Tinkercad Codeblocks</h3>
    <p>Log into Tinkercad using your own account, or the classroom code and nickname we provided during the workshop.</p>
    <p>- the Codeblocks editor</p>
    <p>- design contraints for the Cricut</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="body" class="left">
    <h3>Making the body of a snowman - using cylinders</h3>
    <p>- create an object</p>
    <p>- add body - change radius</p>
    <p>- add head - change radius</p>
    <p>- position head using move block - x, y, z coordinates</p>
    <p>- grouping the shapes together - change the colour, so you know it's finished</p>
    <p>- extra info... what do the other options on the cylinders do?</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="hat" class="left">
    <h3>Creating a hat - using boxes</h3>
    <p>- create a new object (we don't want to mess up the body!)</p>
    <p>- add a box, change width and length, then move into position</p>
    <p>- add another box, change width and length, then move into position</p>
    <p>- group them together - set the colour the same as the body</p>
    <p>- extension - other move blocks e.g. rotate</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="loops" class="left">
    <h3>Adding eyes - using a repeat loop</h3>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>Can you follow the same process to make buttons?</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="shapes" class="left">
    <h3>Finishing touches - adding extra shapes</h3>
    <p>Remember to only use flat shapes in your design.</p>
    <p>To make the smile in my snowman, I used the Text block, with a bracket <strong>)</strong>.</p>
    <p>You will need to use the move blocks to get shapes to look how you want - move, rotate, size.</p>
    <p>Be patient, do things on step at a time, and enjoy the creation process!</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="step12" class="left">
    <h3>Check your design, ready to cut</h3>
    <p>When you are happy with your design, it is almost ready to be physically created!</p>
    <p>Rotate around your design to make sure everything is flat on the workplane. <strong>If not, debug your code!</strong></p>
    <p>When you are ready, tell the workshop leader that your design is finished - we will give it one last check, and then cut your creation!</p>
